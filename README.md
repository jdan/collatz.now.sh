This generates SVGs for [Collatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) sequences. This technique comes from an excellent Numberphile video on the [Recam√°n sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGC5TdIiT9U),

It is written in OCaml, and compiled to JavaScript using [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io/) to be served with [Now](https://now.sh).
